# Input parameters for the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm
# This file defines the model type and numerical parameters required to run the simulation.

# MODEL SELECTION:
# Choose from: spinless, SSH, Hubbard, SSHH (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard)
Model = spinless  

# NUMBER OF STATES KEPT:
# m: Number of states kept during finite-size DMRG sweeps (affects accuracy & runtime).
m = 10

# WARM-UP STATES:
# m_warm: Number of states kept during infinite-size DMRG (initialization step).
m_warm = 10  

# NUMBER OF SWEEPS:
# N_sweeps: Number of finite DMRG sweeps (more sweeps improve convergence).
N_sweeps = 4  

# SYSTEM SIZE:
# L: Number of sites in the 1D lattice.
L = 4  

# MEASUREMENTS:
# Choose which quantity to measure: N (particle number), Sz (magnetization), etc.
Measure = N
